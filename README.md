# Bomberman

This is a very old project I made on my own.
It was the first game I made from scratch (SFML only), 
probably when I was a kid, so I let the sources here
because it's fun to me to see my very old code style.
Maybe someday I'll make it more user-friendly
(including it into a VS19 solution with a proper
"getting started" in this readme).
